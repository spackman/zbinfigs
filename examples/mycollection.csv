The experimental goal is to measure the redox potential, Eh, and a corresponding state of oxidation or reduction of a redox couple: Eh is measured by electrodes, while the state of oxidation-reduction of a redox component is measured by some physical technique, usually some form of spectrometry. The character of the biological redox component usually dictates the chosen technique; the character also will dictate whether the oxidized or reduced form is measured. Several such correlations of Eh and state of oxidation or reduction should be taken at Eh values that extend over the range that encompasses the central part of the expected Nernst curve. To make the analysis straightforward it is preferable to obtain readings for the state of oxidation-reduction as nearly fully oxidized and reduced as possible. The information in the chapter describes the Nernst curve of the redox couple and provides the standard half reduction or midpoint potential value and the number of electrons.",1/1/1978,6/21/2023 17:20,6/21/2023 17:20,6/21/2023 17:20,411-435,,,54,,,[23] Redox potentiometry,Biomembranes - Part E: Biological Oxidations,,,,Academic Press,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,DOI: 10.1016/S0076-6879(78)54026-3,,.\Zotero\storage\B5QRBI2N\Leslie Dutton - 1978 - [23] Redox potentiometry Determination of midpoin.pdf; C:\Users\isaac\Zotero\storage\CR56IDRB\S0076687978540263.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS.",2/25/2022,6/10/2024 19:40,6/10/2024 19:40,6/10/2024 19:40,151003,,,809,,Science of The Total Environment,<i>Per</i>- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and wastewater,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,Zotero/storage/76NZSYFS/Kurwadkar et al. - 2022 - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in wate.pdf; C:\Users\isaac\Zotero\storage\MKDMZGSX\S0048969721060812.html,,,PFOA; PFOS; PFAS; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Environmental pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proof of concept and initial applications are presented for the HIV-inactivating lectin Cyanovirin-N. Single F atoms were introduced at the 4-, 5-, 6- or 7 positions of Trp49 and the 4 position of Phe4, Phe54 and Phe80. The paramagnetic MTSL label was attached to Cys residues that were placed into the protein at positions 50 or 52. 19F-T2 NMR spectra with different relaxation delays were recorded and the transverse 19F-PRE rate, 19F- Γ2, was used to determine the average distance between the F nucleus and the paramagnetic center. Our data show that experimental 19F PRE based distances correspond to ~0.93 of the 1HN-PRE distances, in perfect agreement with the gyromagnetic γ19F/γ1H ratio, thereby demonstrating that 19F PREs are excellent alternative parameters for quantitative distance measurements in selectively F-labeled proteins.",1/4/2016,8/27/2024 18:54,8/27/2024 18:54,8/27/2024 18:54,150-154,,1,55,,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,19F Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 26510989 PMCID: PMC4715678,,Zotero/storage/W2XN7R45/Matei and Gronenborn - 2016 - 19F Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement A Valuabl.pdf; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715678/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the use of 19F paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR in combination with 19F/paramagnetic labeling to equivalent sites in different subunits of a protein complex in micelles to determine intersubunit distances. The feasibility of this strategy was evaluated on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, for which we found excellent agreement of the 19F PRE NMR results with previous structural information.

The study aims to understand the potential developmental toxicity of 2,4-DCP by using the in vivo zebrafish. We exposed the 2,4-DCP to the zebrafish embryos and collected the samples at several selected developmental stages (70-85% epiboly/10-12 somite/prim-5) for the whole mount in situ hybridization. The staining is used to investigate the ventral patterning, presumptive neural formation, and brain development. Results suggested that the 2,4-DCP exposure (up to 2.5 mg/L) did not affect the tested developmental processes in the survived embryos. Further experiments on lipid accumulation and oxidative stress were carried out at 5 days post fertilization larvae. Results showed the accumulation of oil droplets and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the larvae after the highest dosage exposure (2.5 mg/L). The real-time qPCR results suggested that the alternation of lipid metabolism was due to the reduced mRNA expressions of proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppar-α) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc); while the suppressed glutathione peroxidase (gpx) mRNA expression was responsible for the induction of the ROS. To conclude, the study provided scientific merits of understanding 2,4-DCP toxicity, and suggested the possible underlying mechanism of the defects.",2021,10/17/2024 23:13,10/17/2024 23:13,,113133,,,230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there remain outstanding issues to advance the commercial prospects of the technology and benefit from the economies of scale felt by Li-ion cells, including improving both the rate performance and longevity of cells. To address these challenges, the Faraday Institution, the UK’s independent institute for electrochemical energy storage science and technology, launched the Lithium Sulfur Technology Accelerator (LiSTAR) programme in October 2019.
