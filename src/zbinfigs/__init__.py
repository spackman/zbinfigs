How to use the documentation
----------------------------
Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided
with the code, and a loose standing reference guide, available from
`the Zbinfigs homepage <https://update-link-here>`_.

The docstring examples assume that `zbinfigs` has been imported as ``zbf``::

  >>> import zbinfigs as zbf

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs::

  >>> x = 42
  >>> x = x + 1

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring::

  >>> help(zbf.read_collection)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP
